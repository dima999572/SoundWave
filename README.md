This project is a music/audio platform where users can create playlists by adding various audios using YouTube video URLs. Additionally, users can upload and install their own audio files and convert them to different formats. As the project progresses, I plan to incorporate more features and provide additional details. The primary goal of this project is to study and showcase my back-end skills while exploring.
